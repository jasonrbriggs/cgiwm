# cgiwm

A simple CGI-based webmention receiver. Stores webmentions as a json snippet in a directory, which are then processed separately and the resulting webmentions.json file is copied into the target path in the htdocs dir. Compliant with receiver test #1 and #2 of the webmention [test suite](https://webmention.rocks/).

See [https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/](https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/) for more information.

Usage:

* `cgiwm cgi <queuedir>` to provide a CGI-based webmention end point
* `cgiwm process <queuedir> <htdocs> [--invoke <cmd>]` to process webmention json snippets in the queuedir, and write the results into the correct place in htdocs (separately invoke a command for each webmention.json file created/updated)


Example Apache2 configuration for CGI:
```
ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /usr/lib/cgi-bin/
<Directory "/usr/lib/cgi-bin">
    AllowOverride None
    Options +ExecCGI -MultiViews +SymLinksIfOwnerMatch
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
</Directory>

RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule /webmention-endpoint /cgi-bin/cgiwm.cgi [NC,PT]
```

(obviously, in this example, install the cgiwm executable and associated cgiwm.cgi script in /usr/lib/cgi-bin)

An example crontab entry for converting webmention snippets and producing webmention.json files in the target dir is:

```
*/5 * * * * cronic /usr/lib/cgi-bin/cgiwm process /tmp/ /var/www/
```
